        <h2>Linga Longa Farmstay at Lynton Station Lat: -28.211641 Long: 114.305209</h2>
        <p>Located 500 km north of Perth the farmstay makes an ideal rest point or a place to spend a longer stay. If you are going further North it is 40km off the highway, taking a turn at Northanpton. This is a pleasant drive and should take approximately 45 minutes. Personally i believe the farmstay is worth the detour if you are looking for a place to stay to break up your journey. As a longer term place to visit i can't recommend it enough. An important consideration for us was that it allowed dogs. The farmstay is located next to Lynton Station which contains sevral historic buildings currently under renovation. The owners are very friendly and make every effort to ensure you are enjoying your stay.

                <li>The pitches are large and the owners try to space everyone out so there is no crowding.</li>
                <li>Depending on the season you can have a campfire which for me was a huge bonus. You just have to supply the wood.</li>
                <li>Dogs are allowed.</li>
